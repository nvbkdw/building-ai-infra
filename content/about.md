I'm Ruoyu Huang, an engineer obsessed with making AI infrastructure boring—in the very best way. I have spent the last several years building systems that keep models trained, evaluated, deployed, and cost-efficient for teams shipping real products.

**What you can expect here**

- Deep dives on how I structure data flywheels, evaluation harnesses, and continuous delivery for AI workloads.
- Battle-tested patterns I leaned on while scaling teams: ruthless observability, developer-centric tooling, and principled experimentation.
- Candid notes on what actually breaks in production and the pragmatic trade-offs we make to ship.

If you're building similar stacks, I hope these notes save you a few incident reviews. Say hi on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruoyuhuang/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/ruoyuhuang). Let's keep the conversation going.*** End Patch
